# Chatbot-with-GPT3.5Turbo-API
A simple Python chatbot implemented with official OpenAI API using model `gpt-3.5-turbo`. ChatGPT is powered by `gpt-3.5-turbo`, OpenAIâ€™s most advanced language model.

You can consider it as the code way of using ChatGPT, and demo for OpenAI API.

It's much fun to find that:

1. Using the API to access ChatGPT is **much faster** than directly using the web version of ChatGPT.
2. Replies from ChatGPT are **delivered all at once**(code version), rather than one character at a time(web version).
3. Even in restricted areas(like China mainland), **direct access** is possible without the need for a VPN.
