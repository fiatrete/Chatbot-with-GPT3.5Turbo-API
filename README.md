# Chatbot-with-GPT3.5Turbo-API
A simple Python chatbot implemented with official OpenAI API using model `gpt-3.5-turbo`. ChatGPT is powered by `gpt-3.5-turbo`, OpenAIâ€™s most advanced language model.

It's much fun to find that:

1. Using the API to access ChatGPT is much faster than directly using the web version of ChatGPT.
2. Replies from ChatGPT are delivered all at once, rather than one character at a time.
3. Even in restricted areas(like China mainland), direct access is possible without the need for a VPN.
